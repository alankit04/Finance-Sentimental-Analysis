## 📊 Expected Results  

After running the stock prediction models, you can expect the following outcomes:  

### **1️⃣ Stock Price Forecasting**  
- The models will generate future stock price predictions based on historical data.  
- Predictions will be visualized using line charts to compare actual vs. predicted prices.  

### **2️⃣ Model Performance Comparison**  
- Evaluation metrics such as **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** will be used to compare different models.  
- **Expected Trends:**  
  - **LSTM & RNN** → Expected to capture long-term dependencies and perform well on time-series data.  
  - **XGBoost** → Expected to perform well with engineered features but may struggle with sequential dependencies.  
  - **Logistic Regression** → Suitable for trend classification but may not be as precise for exact price forecasting.  

### **3️⃣ Feature Importance & Market Insights**  
- Identifying key factors (e.g., past prices, trading volume) that influence stock movements.  
- Sentiment analysis (if included) will show how news and financial sentiment affect predictions.  

### **4️⃣ Visualization & Trend Analysis**  
- Graphical representations such as:  
  - 📈 **Stock price trends (Actual vs. Predicted)**  
  - 📊 **Feature importance for predictions**  
  - 📉 **Error analysis across models**
